# Gitpod

To run a Gitpod with this repo:

1) Create a free/paid Gitpod account - https://www.gitpod.io/
2) Log into the account
3) Open a new browser tab and add **https://github.com/RamSailopal/fmql-patients-admin** to the address - This will create a new Gitpod cloud instance.
4) Step 3 is for sample only. If you want to make changes to your own repo, first fork this repo and then add that repo after the **gitpod.io/#** prefix to create a new gitpod intance.
5) Due to blocked cross origin requests, A CORS browser add-on also needs to be added and enabled
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/
   
   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en
   
   With the firefox addon, ensure that the plugin is enabled in the browser header as in the image below:
   
   ![Alt text](https://github.com/RamSailopal/Fileman-d3/raw/main/corsenabled.png?raw=true?raw=true "CORS enabled")
   
   This contrasts to when CORS is disabled as in the image below:
   
   ![Alt text](https://github.com/RamSailopal/Fileman-d3/raw/main/corsdisabled.png?raw=true?raw=true "CORS disabled") 
   
   Once the CORS plugin is enabled, the dTree chart for the global will appear.
   
 6)  Nagivate to the  address:

     http://3001-gitpodaddress
